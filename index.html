                            <h1>About</h1>
                            <p>I am a third year PhD Student in the Computer Science and Communications departments at Northwestern University. I study collaboration within large online communities, with a specific interest in multi-language and multi-cultural platforms.  I am advised by Darren Gergle, and I currently collaborate with Aaron Shaw and Kate Starbird.  My work is supported by the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program.</p>
                            <p>I consider myself a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher, though I work collaborators from a variety of disciplines, including computer science, communications, and computational social science.  My research leverages both qualitative and quantitative methodologies in order to understand and support complex human interactions and relationships.  I tend to start with a problem space or a question, and I learn methodologies in order to address that problem.</p>

                            <p>In my non-academic life I am a cyclist, a trail runner, a skier, and a climber.

                            <br>
                            <p>This project aims to develop a broader, more general view of coordination and conflict in social computing across different language speaking communities. Using trace data of editing behavior, we quantify differences in coordination and conflict activity across the 24 largest language editions of Wikipedia.</p>
                            <p>In future work I aim to investigate how differences in the way editors communicate may bias content production, to explore how multilingual users currently span boundaries to mitigate content asymmetries, and to design tools that intelligently facilitate collaboration across existing linguistic and cultural boundaries.</p>

                            <h2>Uncertainty During Crisis</h2>
                            <br>
                            <p>This project classifies and analyzes expressed online uncertainty during the Paris Attacks of 2016. Prior work indicates that expressed uncertainty is closely tied to the initial formation and subsequent crystallization of rumors. Though rumors are an inevitable component of crisis events, they pose a risk to both emergency responders and affected individuals who rely on complete and correct information for decision making.</p>
                            <p>We make two primary contributions towards understanding the role of uncertainty in rumoring and collective sensemaking. First, we expand on existing coding frameworks in order to categorize uncertainty both outside the scope of specific rumors and across multiple platforms. Second, we apply our framework to Twitter, Reddit, and Wikipedia to illustrate differences and similarities in the sensemaking process on all three platforms.</p>

                            <h2>Communication in Citizen Science Communities</h2>
                            <br>
                            <p>This project investigates the role of communication between amateur (volunteers) and professional scientists (scientists) in citizen science communities using data from the Zooniverse platform. Currently, the platform provides guidelines to science teams on how best to engage volunteers, but these guidelines have never been evaluated empirically, and the specific impacts of particular kinds of interactions between science team members of volunteers remain somewhat unclear.</p>
                            <p>We aim to test whether more involvement by professional scientists, moderators, and Zooniverse employees on Zooniverse community forums results in increased volunteer contributions and decreased rates of volunteer attrition throughout different points during a projectâ€™s timeline.  These findings will refine and inform design recommendations for citizen science platform designers, project creators, volunteers, and science team members</p>
